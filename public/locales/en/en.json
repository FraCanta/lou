Our guided tour started in the Campo with a discussion of the history of Siena, its culture, government structure, and buildings. She did an incredible job of explaining the Palio and its significance. In addition to photos on her laptop, she had video of a race which was fascinating. While in the Campo she also shared information about life in Siena, food treats that we must sample, and her own life experiences. All of this helped us to gain more insight into both the history and current life in the city. From the Campo we went to the Duomo and learned about the initial plans, construction, renovation, and recent discoveries there before entering for a comprehensive tour of the amazing interior. Luisa had an incredible amount of detail to offer about the artwork, its significance, and the stories portrayed within. All of this added to the experience of seeing this amazing church ! Finally, she guided us through the cathedral dedicated to Saint Catherine. Here too, the insight and details of both the church and her life made everything much more meaningful. In addition to her incredible knowledge, Luisa has a warm and engaging personality. She went above and beyond with us in providing details, and generously spent additional time with us to make sure that our interests and the places we wanted to visit were addressed. It was an incredible experience that we highly recommend ! THANK YOU LUISA!!!!"

Attached to the church is the 14th-century chapel with frescoes attributed to Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Fifty years later, further down the valley, the abbey named after St. Galgano was built by the Cistercians. The earliest example of Gothic architecture in Tuscany and one of the most evocative places in the Sienese countryside.

I have a degree in archaeology from Siena and have worked in different areas both in Italy and abroad. When I returned I worked in the archaeological museum in Volterra as a guide for school students and then co-managed an archaeological park on Elba Island.",

I love meeting new people and sharing my passion for history and art with them. I meet people from all over Italy and abroad: this is an opportunity for me to learn about other histories and cultures, a kind of endless journey, fantastic!",
      "finalP": "I love this job and I love doing it in Tuscany, a region where art, history, nature and traditions are perfectly balanced. In fact, with my husband, who is an environmental guide, we also organize some nature walks. If you'd like to stay updated on our outings sign up for the mailing list! I hope to meet you soon in Tuscany. In the meantime, you can find me every day on social. See you soon, Luisa."
